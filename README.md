# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection

For simplicity, I implemented the Z-Score because its efficient and works well for detecting outliers based on deviation from the mean.
It measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Any value that falls outside a predefined threshold will be flagged and pointed out as an anomaly.
